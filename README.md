# Hi there

I made this clone following the frontend preactice website, I used vanilla html, scss, javascript and gulp.

This was an opportunity to practice using viewport units for building responsive websites, the font is not the exact one,
couldn't get the free version of futura fonts.

I'll be building more landing pages in the future, this is my first project in my series of learning to be comfortable with css.
